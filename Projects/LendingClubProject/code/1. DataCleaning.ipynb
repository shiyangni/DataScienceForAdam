    "\n",
    "1. Check data size before reading-in. As a rule of thumb, the data size should be at most 1/4 of the computer's RAM.\n",
    "1. Summarize the variables through grouping. Understand the meaning of each variable, and group them into meaningful baskets.\n",
    "1. Inspect missing values. Analyze their causes, and decides what to do with them.\n",
    "1. Variable transformation. \n",
    "    - Properly format variables. For dates, convert them into computable formats; for texts, remove the redundencies and check for spelling; for numerical values, make sure the units are consistent. \n",
    "    - Expand the scope of data. Can we include more variables that might be of interest?\n",

    "The empty variables fall into one of the three categories: information on joint application, borrower's other credit burdens, and hardship plan status. We think that while both information on co-applicants and hardship status can reveal interesting patterns, only other credit burdens can add material insights to our analysis of default probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information on __joint applicants__. Our dataset only contains information on loans applied for by individuals. However, we don't think that joint application should be treated in a fundamentally different way than an individual ones, as long as we can properly aggregate information on all applicants. In future iterations where joint applications are present, the data should be processed in a similar way to this project.\n",
    "- Applicant's __other credit burdens__. This includes information on the applicant's installment accounts, such as mortgage, auto-loan, and sstudent loans.<span style=\"color:red\"> We think this information can be very helpful for predicting default in some cases. </span> Installment loans typically are collateralized (with the exception of student loans), while Lending Club loans are mostly unsecured, so defaulting on the former usually has a much severer consequence than the latter. If one has already recently defaulted on a mortgage or auto loan, he/she is very likely under significant hardship, and will default on a lending club loan as well. _As such, we recommend including this information in future data collection_.\n",
    "- __Hardship plan status__. Lending Club offers borrowers three-month \"hardship\" plans when only a reduced installment has to be paid. Analysis on hardship plan data can shed light on some interesting questions, such as whether enrollment in the hardship plan signals stronger willingness to avoid default, should Lending Club make automatic recommendation of hardship plans to all borrower's likely to become delinquent, etc. \n",

As we don't know whether the blank values indicate no such incidences occur or no data available, we discard them in this iteration.<span style=\"color:orange\"> A total of 749 data points (about 2% of the training set) are removed from the training set; 1 data point is removed from the test set. </span> <span style=\"color:red\"> We think that in future iteration, such inconsistency can be resolved through better exception handling on when referencing external databases </span> \n",
