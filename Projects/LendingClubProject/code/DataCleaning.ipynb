    "We follow the __Quartz: Bad Data Guide__ at https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide, and conduct the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check data size before reading-in. As a rule of thumb, the data size should be at most 1/4 of the computer's RAM.\n",
    "1. Summarize the variables through grouping. Understand the meaning of each variable, and group them into meaningful baskets.\n",
    "1. Inspect missing values. Analyze their causes, and decides what to do with them.\n",
    "1. Variable transformation. \n",
    "    - Properly format variables. For dates, convert them into computable formats; for texts, remove the redundencies and check for spelling; for numerical values, make sure the units are consistent. \n",
    "    - Analyze scope of the data. Does the dataset include enough variables to provide meaningful answers to the questions we're interested in?\n",
    "    - Check granularity of data. What does each data point represent and in what ways can they be meaningufully aggregated?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We first do each step manually, then wrap our actions into functions so that the process is more replicable on new datasets. We export the cleaned training and test set."

    "\n",
    "The empty variables fall into one of the three categories: information on joint application, borrower's other credit burdens, and hardship plan status. We think that while both information on co-applicants and hardship status can reveal interesting patterns, only other credit burdens can add material insights to our analysis of default probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information on __joint applicants__. Our dataset only contains information on loans applied for by individuals. However, we don't think that joint application should be treated in a fundamentally different way than an individual ones, as long as we can properly aggregate information on all applicants. In future iterations where joint applications are present, the data should be processed in a similar way to this project.\n",
    "- Applicant's __other credit burdens__. This includes information on the applicant's installment accounts, such as mortgage, auto-loan, and sstudent loans.<span style=\"color:red\"> We think this information can be very helpful for predicting default in some cases. </span> Installment loans typically are collateralized (with the exception of student loans), while Lending Club loans are mostly unsecured, so defaulting on the former usually has a much severer consequence than the latter. If one has already recently defaulted on a mortgage or auto loan, he/she is very likely under significant hardship, and will default on a lending club loan as well. _As such, we recommend including this information in future data collection_.\n",
    "- __Hardship plan status__. Lending Club offers borrowers three-month \"hardship\" plans when only a reduced installment has to be paid. Analysis on hardship plan data can shed light on some interesting questions, such as whether enrollment in the hardship plan signals stronger willingness to avoid default, should Lending Club make automatic recommendation of hardship plans to all borrower's likely to become delinquent, etc. \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to pay off 3 of my credit cards with high interest and do it in a reasonable amount of time, 3 years or sooner.  It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to pay off 3 of my credit cards with high interest and do it in a reasonable amount of time, 3 years or sooner.  It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.

       "35055  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to pay off 3 of my credit cards with high interest and do it in a reasonable amount of time, 3 years or sooner.  It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",

I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.</td>\n",

       "35639  Simply looking to pay off credit cards, consolidating balances, and reduce the debt carrying costs.  The banking industry and it's credit card cartel are insidious. I believe history will judge this business harshly, for their monopoly position in the electronic payments space with only the appearance of competition, and for the harm their business model inflicts on a massive scale.    I'm clearly a little unhappy with these folks, their policies and my recent customer service interactions with them have driven me here.  I'm considering liquidating some assets just to be done with them.  The ways they have come up with to gouge their customers are absolutely unbelievable.  At this point I plan on being done with them as soon as possible, one way or another, and I'd much rather pay interest to individual investors than these bottom feeders.   \n",

It would take me 10 years or more of minimum payments to accomplish this without consolidating them and paying them off in a shorter period of time.  I want to be debt free by the time my son, who is 11 goes to college, so I can help him out if he needs me to with tuition and books.  This gives me about 6 years to become completely debt free and this is my first real stabb at getting there.  My credit is good, I pay things on time since a bankruptcy I had in 1988, due to a business partnership breaking up.  This will be completely off my record in September of 2008, and I am very committed to keeping my good credit and increasing my credit score as much as possible.   \n",
